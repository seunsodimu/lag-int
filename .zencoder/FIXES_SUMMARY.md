# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: "Call to a member function info() on null" Error on Order Sync

**Problem:**
When syncing an order after providing a Customer NetSuite ID through the order-status-manager, the order would sync successfully to NetSuite, but the page would display an error: "An unexpected error occurred: Call to a member function info() on null"

**Root Cause:**
The `EnhancedEmailService` was attempting to initialize `NotificationSettingsService` in its constructor without proper error handling. If the `NotificationSettingsService` initialization failed (e.g., database connection issues), the constructor would fail and throw an exception, causing the entire email notification system to break.

**Fix Applied:**
Modified `EnhancedEmailService.php`:
- Wrapped `NotificationSettingsService` initialization in a try-catch block in the constructor
- Added fallback logic to use default email recipients from config if NotificationSettingsService is unavailable
- Updated all notification methods (`send3DCartOrderNotification`, `sendHubSpotSyncNotification`, `sendOrderNotification`, `sendFailedOrderNotification`, `sendNotificationByType`) to check if `$this->notificationSettings` is null and use fallback recipients

**Result:**
- Orders now sync successfully without throwing null reference errors
- Email notifications still attempt to send using default recipients even if the notification settings service fails
- Better error logging for debugging when notification settings service fails

### Issue 2: Emails Not Being Sent After Order Sync

**Problem:**
After orders were synced (both via webhook and manual syncing), email notifications were not being sent to recipients

**Root Causes Identified and Fixed:**

1. **No Error Handling Around Email Sending in WebhookController**
   - Email sending failures could cause exceptions that break the entire order processing flow
   - Exceptions in email sending were not being caught and logged separately

2. **Missing Fallback Recipient Logic**
   - If NotificationSettingsService was unavailable, there was no fallback to default recipients
   - This caused the email system to fail silently

3. **Credential Configuration Issues**
   - The email service depends on properly configured credentials in `config/credentials.php`
   - The application had no fallback if credentials were missing

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **WebhookController.php** - Wrapped all email sending calls in try-catch blocks:
   - `processOrder()` method: Wrapped success notification email sending
   - `processOrder()` method: Wrapped error notification email sending  
   - `processOrderWithCustomer()` method: Wrapped success notification email sending
   - `processOrderWithCustomer()` method: Wrapped error notification email sending

   Each try-catch block:
   - Logs failures as warnings instead of throwing exceptions
   - Allows order processing to complete successfully even if email sending fails
   - Maintains a clear separation between order sync success and email delivery success

2. **EnhancedEmailService.php** - Added robust fallback logic:
   - All methods now check if `notificationSettings` is null
   - If null, uses `$this->config['to_emails']` as fallback
   - If that's also empty, uses the hardcoded default recipient `'web_dev@lagunatools.com'`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Order Sync with Custom Customer ID**
   - Go to order-status-manager.php
   - Enter an order ID and a valid NetSuite Customer ID
   - Verify the order syncs without error and returns success JSON

2. **Test Email Delivery**
   - After syncing an order, check that:
     - A success email is sent to the configured recipients
     - Check logs/app-YYYY-MM-DD.log for email sending confirmation
     - Verify the email was delivered to `seun_sodimu@lagunatools.com` (default recipient)

3. **Test with Unavailable NotificationSettingsService**
   - Stop the database temporarily to simulate a connection failure
   - Sync an order
   - Verify that:
     - Order still syncs successfully
     - Email sending falls back to default recipients
     - Error is logged with details about the NotificationSettingsService failure

4. **Test Email Failure Scenarios**
   - Check logs for email sending status
   - Verify that even if email sending fails, the order sync returns success

## Configuration Notes

To ensure emails are sent properly:

1. **Verify .env file has SendGrid credentials:**
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
   NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@lagunatools.com
   NOTIFICATION_TO_EMAILS=your-email@example.com
   ```

2. **Verify database has notification_settings table:**
   - If the table doesn't exist, the system will use default config recipients
   - Recipients configured in the notification_settings table take precedence

3. **Check config/config.php:**
   - `notifications.enabled` should be `true`
   - `notifications.to_emails` should have at least one email address

---

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Email sending is wrapped in try-catch with no retry logic, failures are logged and reported
- **Logging**: Added warning-level logs for email failures (not debug, so they appear in standard logs)
- **Order Processing**: No impact on order sync performance; email sending happens after order is already created in NetSuite

---

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing email retry logic with exponential backoff
2. Add email delivery status tracking to the database
3. Implement email sending queue for asynchronous processing
4. Add more granular email recipient configuration options
5. Implement email bounce handling and automatic recipient cleanup
