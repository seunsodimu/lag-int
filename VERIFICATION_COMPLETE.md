## Store Shipment Orders Fix - All Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: "Class not found" Error ✓ FIXED
**Status**: RESOLVED

The error `An unexpected error occurred: Class "LagunaIntegrations\Exceptions\StoreCustomerNotFoundException" not found` is now fixed.

**Root Cause**: Namespace mismatch - exception was defined with `LagunaIntegrations\Exceptions` but the PSR-4 autoload namespace is `Laguna\Integration\`.

**Resolution**:
- ✓ Updated `src/Exceptions/StoreCustomerNotFoundException.php` namespace to `Laguna\Integration\Exceptions`
- ✓ Updated throw statements in `src/Services/NetSuiteService.php` (2 occurrences)
- ✓ Added proper import in `src/Controllers/WebhookController.php`

---

### Issue #2: Store Shipment Orders Not Blocking ✓ WORKING
**Status**: RESOLVED

Store Shipment orders with missing store customers are now properly blocked from syncing.

**Implementation**:
- ✓ Exception properly thrown when store customer not found
- ✓ Exception properly caught with correct namespace
- ✓ Processing halted, order not synced
- ✓ Customer not created

**Code Path**:
```
WebhookController::processOrder()
    └─> NetSuiteService::assignCustomerByPaymentMethod()
        └─> NetSuiteService::findStoreCustomer()
            └─> If not found: throw StoreCustomerNotFoundException ✓
```

### Issue #3: Email Notifications Not Sent ✓ FIXED
**Status**: RESOLVED

Email notifications are now sent when store customer is not found.

**Implementation**:
- ✓ Exception caught properly with correct namespace
- ✓ Email service method called: `sendNotification()`
- ✓ Notification type: `store_customer_not_found`
- ✓ Email sent to: `NOTIFICATION_TO_EMAILS` from config
- ✓ Email includes: Order ID, customer email, error message, action link

**Email Recipients**: Configured in `.env`:
```
NOTIFICATION_TO_EMAILS=seun_sodimu@lagunatools.com
```

**Code Path**:
```
WebhookController::processOrder()
    ├─> catch (StoreCustomerNotFoundException $e)
    │   └─> emailService->sendNotification() ✓
    └─> Log error ✓
```

### Issue #4: Manual Override on Order Status Manager ✓ WORKING
**Status**: VERIFIED

Manual order processing via Order Status Manager is now working correctly.

**Scenarios**:

1. **With Customer ID Provided**:
   - ✓ Calls `processOrderWithCustomer()`
   - ✓ Creates sales order with specified customer
   - ✓ Sends success email

2. **Without Customer ID (Create New Customer)**:
   - ✓ Calls `processOrder()`
   - ✓ Creates new customer or finds existing by email
   - ✓ Creates sales order
   - ✓ Sends success email

3. **Store Shipment Without Customer ID**:
   - ✓ Checks for store customer
   - ✓ If found: Creates order ✓
   - ✓ If not found: Blocks, sends email with action link ✓
