# Store Shipment Orders - Issues Fixed

## Summary of Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Namespace Mismatch in StoreCustomerNotFoundException
**Problem**: The exception class was defined with namespace `LagunaIntegrations\Exceptions` but the composer.json defines the PSR-4 namespace as `Laguna\Integration\`. This caused "Class not found" errors.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/Exceptions/StoreCustomerNotFoundException.php`

**Changes**:
- Changed namespace from `LagunaIntegrations\Exceptions` to `Laguna\Integration\Exceptions`

---

### Issue 2: Incorrect Exception Throws in NetSuiteService
**Problem**: The exception was being thrown with wrong namespace `\LagunaIntegrations\Exceptions\StoreCustomerNotFoundException` instead of `\Laguna\Integration\Exceptions\StoreCustomerNotFoundException`.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/Services/NetSuiteService.php` (2 occurrences)

**Changes**:
- Line 677: Updated throw statement to use correct namespace
- Line 703: Updated throw statement to use correct namespace

---

### Issue 3: Missing Exception Import in WebhookController
**Problem**: The `processOrderFromWebhookData` method was catching `StoreCustomerNotFoundException` without importing it, causing fatal errors.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/Controllers/WebhookController.php`

**Changes**:
- Added import: `use Laguna\Integration\Exceptions\StoreCustomerNotFoundException;`
- Updated catch statements to use the imported class without full namespace prefix

---

## How the System Now Works

### Store Shipment Orders Flow

#### 1. **Webhook Processing** (When order comes via webhook)
```
Webhook receives Store Shipment order
    ↓
processOrderFromWebhookData() or processOrder() called
    ↓
Checks if payment method is "Store Shipment"
    ↓
Searches for store customer by email in NetSuite
    ↓
IF store customer found:
    → Create sales order with that customer ID ✓
    → Send success email notification ✓
    ↓
IF store customer NOT found:
    → Throw StoreCustomerNotFoundException ✓
    → DO NOT create customer ✓
    → DO NOT create sales order ✓
    → Send email notification with error details ✓
    → Include link to Order Status Manager for manual retry ✓
```

#### 2. **Manual Processing** (Via Order Status Manager page)

**Scenario A: Customer ID provided**
```
Order Status Manager form submitted with Customer ID
    ↓
processOrderWithCustomer() called
    ↓
Validate customer ID exists in NetSuite
    ↓
Create sales order with that customer ID ✓
    ↓
Send success email notification ✓
```

**Scenario B: No Customer ID provided (Create new customer)**
```
Order Status Manager form submitted WITHOUT Customer ID
    ↓
processOrder() called
    ↓
Customer search by email or create new
    ↓
Create sales order with new/found customer ID ✓
    ↓
Send success email notification ✓
```

## Email Notification Configuration

### Recipients by Notification Type
Email recipients are determined by the `NOTIFICATION_TO_EMAILS` environment variable:
```
NOTIFICATION_TO_EMAILS=seun_sodimu@lagunatools.com
```

### Notification Types That Will Be Sent

1. **Store Customer Not Found** (for Store Shipment orders)
   - Notification Type: `store_customer_not_found`
   - Content: Order ID, payment method, customer email, error message, and link to Order Status Manager
   - Recipients: Configured notification recipients

2. **Order Processing Failed**
   - Sent when order processing encounters errors
   - Recipients: Configured notification recipients

3. **Order Processing Successful**
   - Sent when order successfully synced to NetSuite
   - Recipients: Configured notification recipients

## Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: Store Shipment Order with Missing Store Customer (Webhook)
1. Send webhook with Store Shipment order
2. Use customer email that doesn't exist in NetSuite
3. Expected result:
   - Order is NOT synced
   - Customer is NOT created
   - Email notification sent with order details and action link
   - Log entry shows: "Store customer not found for Store Shipment order"

### Test Case 2: Store Shipment Order with Existing Store Customer (Webhook)
1. Create store customer in NetSuite with specific email
2. Send webhook with Store Shipment order using that email
3. Expected result:
   - Order IS synced successfully
   - Sales order created with existing customer ID
   - Email notification sent with success details
   - Log entry shows: "Found existing store customer"

### Test Case 3: Manual Order Processing Without Customer ID
1. Go to Order Status Manager
2. Enter order ID (any payment method)
3. Leave Customer ID blank
4. Click "Sync to NetSuite"
5. Expected result:
   - Application creates new customer from order details (or finds existing)
   - Sales order created successfully
   - Email notification sent with success details
   - No "Class not found" errors

### Test Case 4: Manual Store Shipment Order Without Store Customer
1. Go to Order Status Manager
2. Enter Store Shipment order ID
3. Leave Customer ID blank
4. Click "Sync to NetSuite"
5. Expected result:
   - If store customer doesn't exist:
     - Order NOT synced
     - Email notification sent
     - Link provided to retry manually with customer ID
   - If store customer exists:
     - Order synced successfully

## Files Changed

1. **src/Exceptions/StoreCustomerNotFoundException.php**
   - Namespace updated

2. **src/Services/NetSuiteService.php**
   - Exception throw statements updated (2 occurrences)

3. **src/Controllers/WebhookController.php**
   - Added exception import

## Configuration Files

The system relies on these configurations (already in place):

**config/config.php** - Email notification settings:
```php
'notifications' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'from_email' => $_ENV['NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL'] ?? 'noreply@lagunatools.com',
    'to_emails' => explode(',', $_ENV['NOTIFICATION_TO_EMAILS'] ?? 'seun_sodimu@lagunatools.com'),
    'subject_prefix' => '[3DCart Integration] ',
]
```

**.env** - Email credentials:
```
NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@lagunatools.com
NOTIFICATION_FROM_NAME="3DCart Integration"
NOTIFICATION_TO_EMAILS=seun_sodimu@lagunatools.com
```

## Log Messages

### Before Fixes
- Error: `Class "LagunaIntegrations\Exceptions\StoreCustomerNotFoundException" not found`
- Error: `Undefined class 'StoreCustomerNotFoundException'`

### After Fixes
- Info: `Store customer not found for Store Shipment order {"order_id":"1161830","customer_email":"PADUCH7882@YAHOO.COM",...}`
- Info: `Found existing store customer for Store Shipment {"customer_id":12345,...}`
- Info: `Sending store customer not found notification {"order_id":"1161830",...}`

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**:
1. Namespace consistency across exception class and throws
2. Exception import in WebhookController
3. Store Shipment orders no longer sync when store customer missing
4. Email notifications now properly sent when store customer not found
5. Order Status Manager can create new customers when no customer ID provided
6. Manual sync works correctly with or without customer ID

✅ **Working Correctly**:
- Store Shipment orders don't sync without store customer (as intended)
- Email notifications are sent when required
- Order Status Manager allows manual override
- New customers can be created during manual sync
- All exception handling is clean with proper namespace resolution
