# Deployment Notes: Store Shipment Orders Fix

## Changes Summary

This deployment fixes critical issues with Store Shipment order processing, email notifications, and exception handling.

### What Was Fixed

1. **Exception Namespace Bug** - Critical
   - Fixed `StoreCustomerNotFoundException` namespace mismatch
   - Was: `LagunaIntegrations\Exceptions` â†’ Now: `Laguna\Integration\Exceptions`
   - This was causing "Class not found" fatal errors

2. **Email Notifications** - Now Working
   - Store customer not found emails now properly sent
   - Recipients: Configured in `NOTIFICATION_TO_EMAILS` environment variable
   - Email includes order details and link to Order Status Manager

3. **Order Processing Logic** - Enhanced
   - Store Shipment orders without store customer: NO SYNC + EMAIL ALERT
   - Manual override via Order Status Manager: ALLOWED
   - New customer creation: SUPPORTED
