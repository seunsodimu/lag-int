2. Optionally add the shipping address to the customer profile
3. Optionally add the billing address to the customer profile

### Store Shipment Customer Validation
4. Validate that store customers exist in NetSuite for "Store Shipment" payment method orders
5. Send email notifications with direct order links when validation fails

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All required components have been successfully implemented and integrated.

## Files Modified

### 1. `public/order-status-manager.php`

#### Frontend Changes (Lines 126-175 approx):
- **Added "NetSuite Customer Options" section** in the 3DCart Order Information display
  - Only visible when order is not yet synced (`canEdit = true`)
  - Styled with light blue background (#e3f2fd) for visual distinction
  
- **Three new input fields:**
  1. **Customer NetSuite ID** - Text input field
     - Placeholder: "Enter NetSuite Customer ID (optional)"
     - Helper text: "If specified, the order will be associated with this customer ID"
  
  2. **Add Shipping Address** - Checkbox
     - Label: "Add shipping address to customer profile"
  
  3. **Add Billing Address** - Checkbox
     - Label: "Add billing address to customer profile"

#### JavaScript Changes (Lines 874-933 approx):
- **Modified `syncToNetSuite()` function** to:
  - Retrieve values from the new input fields
  - Build enhanced confirmation message showing:
    - Customer ID (if provided)
    - Selected address options
  - Include new parameters in AJAX request:
    - `customer_id`
    - `add_shipping_address`
    - `add_billing_address`

#### Backend Changes (Lines 697-731 approx):
- **Enhanced `sync_to_netsuite` action handler** to:
  - Accept three new POST parameters:
    - `customer_id` (optional)
    - `add_shipping_address` (boolean)
    - `add_billing_address` (boolean)
  
  - **Customer ID Validation:**
    - If customer ID is provided, validate it exists in NetSuite
    - Return user-friendly error if customer doesn't exist:
      ```
      "Customer ID {id} does not exist in NetSuite. Please create the customer first."
      ```
  
  - **Route to appropriate processing method:**
    - With customer ID → `processOrderWithCustomer()`
    - Without customer ID → `processOrder()` (existing logic)

---

### 2. `src/Controllers/WebhookController.php`

#### New Method: `processOrderWithCustomer()` (Lines 253-373 approx)

**Purpose:** Process orders with a manually specified customer ID, bypassing automatic customer finding/creation.

**Key Features:**
- Validates customer exists before processing
- Adds addresses to customer profile when requested
- Creates sales order with specified customer ID
- Updates 3DCart order status on success
- Sends email notifications for both success and failure
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

**Process Flow:**
1. Validate customer exists in NetSuite
2. If address options selected, add addresses to customer
3. Create sales order with specified customer ID
4. Update 3DCart order status to "Processing"
5. Send success email notification
6. Handle errors with retry logic and failure notifications

**Error Handling:**
- Customer validation errors
- Address addition failures (non-blocking)
- Sales order creation failures
- 3DCart status update failures
- Email notification failures

---

### 3. `src/Services/NetSuiteService.php`

#### New Method 1: `validateCustomerExists()` (Lines 1335-1381)

**Purpose:** Validate if a customer exists in NetSuite by customer ID.

**Implementation:**
- Uses SuiteQL query to check customer existence
- Returns boolean (true if exists, false otherwise)
- Logs customer details when found:
  - Customer name
  - Company name
  - Email
  - isPerson status
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Query Used:**
```sql
SELECT id, firstName, lastName, email, companyName, isperson 
FROM customer 
WHERE id = {customerId}
```

#### New Method 2: `addAddressesToCustomer()` (Lines 1383-1543)

**Purpose:** Add shipping and/or billing addresses to an existing NetSuite customer.

**Parameters:**
- `$customerId` - NetSuite customer ID
- `$orderData` - 3DCart order data containing address information
- `$addShipping` - Boolean flag for shipping address
- `$addBilling` - Boolean flag for billing address

**Implementation:**
- Validates customer exists before adding addresses
- Builds address book items from 3DCart order data
- Uses PATCH request to update customer record
- Handles both shipping and billing addresses
- Includes proper field validation and truncation
- Maps country codes correctly
- Logs all operations for audit trail

**Address Fields Mapped:**
- **Shipping Address** (from ShipmentList):
  - Addressee (First + Last Name)
  - Address Line 1 & 2
  - City, State, ZIP
  - Country (mapped)
  - Phone

- **Billing Address** (from order data):
  - Addressee (First + Last Name)
  - Address Line 1 & 2
  - City, State, ZIP
  - Country (mapped)
  - Phone

**Address Labels:**
- Shipping: "Shipping Address (3DCart Order #{OrderID})"
- Billing: "Billing Address (3DCart Order #{OrderID})"

---

## Technical Details

### Backward Compatibility
✅ **Fully maintained** - If no customer ID is provided, the system uses existing automatic customer finding/creation logic.

### Validation Flow
1. **Frontend validation** - Basic input validation
2. **Backend validation** - Customer existence check via `validateCustomerExists()`
3. **Pre-processing validation** - Before order creation
4. **Immediate feedback** - User-friendly error messages

### Error Messages
- **Customer not found:** "Customer ID {id} does not exist in NetSuite. Please create the customer first."
- **Address addition failure:** Logged but non-blocking (order still processes)
- **Order creation failure:** Full error details with retry logic

### Logging
All operations include comprehensive logging:
- Customer validation attempts
- Address addition operations
- Order processing steps
- Success/failure outcomes
- API call durations

### Email Notifications
- **Success:** Order processed with customer ID and address options
- **Failure:** Detailed error information for troubleshooting

## Usage Instructions

### For End Users:

1. **Open Order Status Manager** and select an unsynced order
2. **Navigate to "3DCart Order Information" tab**
3. **Locate "NetSuite Customer Options" section** (light blue background)
4. **Enter Customer NetSuite ID** (optional):
   - Must be a valid NetSuite customer ID
   - System will validate before processing
5. **Select address options** (optional):
   - Check "Add shipping address to customer profile" to add shipping address
   - Check "Add billing address to customer profile" to add billing address
6. **Click "Sync to NetSuite"**
7. **Confirm the action** in the popup dialog
8. **Wait for processing** - Success/error message will appear

### Example Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Process order with existing customer**
- Enter Customer ID: `12345`
- Leave address checkboxes unchecked
- Result: Order created and linked to customer 12345

**Scenario 2: Process order and add addresses**
- Enter Customer ID: `12345`
- Check both address checkboxes
- Result: Order created, shipping and billing addresses added to customer 12345

**Scenario 3: Invalid customer ID**
- Enter Customer ID: `99999` (doesn't exist)
- Result: Error message - "Customer ID 99999 does not exist in NetSuite. Please create the customer first."

**Scenario 4: No customer ID (existing behavior)**
- Leave Customer ID field empty
- Result: System automatically finds/creates customer using existing logic

## Maintenance Notes

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Address Deduplication:** Check if addresses already exist before adding
2. **Address Book Management:** Allow users to select from existing addresses

4. **Customer Search:** Add customer search/autocomplete in UI
5. **Address Validation:** Integrate address validation service

### Known Limitations:
1. Only processes first shipment for shipping address
2. Addresses are added as new entries (no duplicate checking)
3. No UI feedback during address addition (happens in background)

### Dependencies:
- NetSuite REST API access
- 3DCart API access
- PHP 7.4+
- Guzzle HTTP client
- Existing authentication system
