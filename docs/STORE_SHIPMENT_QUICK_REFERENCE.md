# Store Shipment Quick Reference Guide

## What is Store Shipment?

**Store Shipment** is a payment method where orders are shipped to a store location. The store customer must already exist in NetSuite before the order can be processed.

## Key Differences

| Feature | Store Shipment | Other Payment Methods |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Customer Creation | ‚ùå Never auto-creates | ‚úÖ Auto-creates if needed |
| Validation | ‚úÖ Must exist in NetSuite | ‚ö†Ô∏è Creates if missing |
| Failure Behavior | üõë Stops immediately | üîÑ May retry |
| Email Notification | ‚úÖ With order link | ‚úÖ Standard notification |

## How It Works

### 1. Order Received
```
Payment Method: "Store Shipment"
QuestionList ‚Üí QuestionID=1 ‚Üí QuestionAnswer: "store@example.com"
```

### 2. System Validates
- ‚úÖ Extracts email from QuestionList
- ‚úÖ Validates email format
- ‚úÖ Searches NetSuite for customer

### 3. Two Outcomes

#### ‚úÖ Customer Found
```
‚Üí Use customer ID
‚Üí Process order normally
‚Üí Create sales order in NetSuite
```

#### ‚ùå Customer NOT Found
```
‚Üí Stop processing
‚Üí Log error with details
‚Üí Send email with order link
‚Üí Return failure (no retry)
‚Üí Manual action required
```

## Email Notification

When a Store Shipment customer is not found, administrators receive:

```
Subject: Failed Order Notification - Store Customer Not Found

Order ID: 1234567
Payment Method: Store Shipment
Customer Email: store@example.com
Error: Store customer 'store@example.com' does not exist in NetSuite

Action Required: Create the store customer in NetSuite first, then retry this order

View Order: [Click here to view order]
```

## Manual Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Check Email
1. Open the failed order notification email
2. Note the customer email address

### Step 2: Create Customer in NetSuite
1. Log into NetSuite
2. Navigate to: Lists ‚Üí Relationships ‚Üí Customers ‚Üí New
3. Enter customer details with the exact email from the notification
4. Save the customer

### Step 3: Retry Order
1. Click the order link in the email (opens Order Status Manager)
2. Click "Retry Processing" button
3. Order should now process successfully

## Configuration

### Environment Variable (Production)
```bash
APP_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com/lag-int
```

### Default (Development)
```
http://localhost/lag-int
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "No email provided"
**Cause**: QuestionList missing or empty  
**Solution**: Verify 3DCart webhook includes QuestionList with QuestionID=1

### Issue: "Invalid email format"
**Cause**: Email in QuestionAnswer is not valid  
**Solution**: Check QuestionAnswer value, ensure it's a valid email

### Issue: Order link doesn't work
**Cause**: Incorrect base_url configuration  
**Solution**: Set APP_BASE_URL environment variable

### Issue: Customer exists but still fails
**Cause**: Email mismatch between order and NetSuite  
**Solution**: Verify exact email match (case-insensitive search is used)

- Order ID
